# University Projects
This repo contains the majority of my university projects

## Stage 3
Due to few computing componets in semester 1, I have focused on learning Python. Please see my other repos for this. I will be learning Fortran in the next semester, and will update this repo with projects.

#### Mandelbrot and Julia sets
These two functions were developed for the group project module.

[Mandelbrot function](Stage-2/mandelbrot.m)

[Julia function](Stage-2/julia.m)

*Project grade:* 70%

#### Heapsort 
Part of a stage 2 project was to code a heapsort function:

[Heapsort project](Stage-2/heapsort.m)

*Project grade:* 67%

## Stage 1 
#### MATLAB GUI 
The following project was completed during stage 1 chemical engineer; stage 1 maths coding projects were relatively small and simple and so will not be displayed.
This project involved developing a GUI, a dataset was given and the task was to create a GUI to display the data. This was the first large MATLAB project I completed.
